# Chatbots

### Telegram Chatbot
A basic AI-enabled chatbot called "Jarvis" which I built and deployed on Telegram for personal skills development. The bot is created to make service bookings for "Krusty's resturant". It converses mainly in English. The chatbot can be found here [bot](https://t.me/MoCwere_Bot). 
I created the bot using [Dialogflow](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/) on Google Cloud Platform.

### AWS Weather Chatbot App
A chatbot that can be queried for weather information for a given city. The chatbot is built using Amazon Lex on AWS cloud. Users can interact with it through a web application that can be accessed [here](https://d2myyb3g9idv1l.cloudfront.net/). A REST API is used to connect the chatbot to a NoSQL database with historic weather information that can be queried.
